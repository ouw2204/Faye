# Do, State, and Reactive
Do and State work like functions, but they react to value's change
## Do
```lua
local Value = Thread:Value(33)
Thread:Create "TextLabel" {
    Thread:Do(function(Grab, Thread, Entity)
    
    end)
}
```
As you can see the first param is a **Grab** function, <mark>if you use it on any value it will return that Value's current value and will recall the Do utility everytime that value is updated</mark>. The second is the **Thread** that created the Do utility, for State its vital that you use it correctly but for Do since its just the Thread that created it, it isn't that important, and the **Entity** is the current Faye Instance in question just like in a function.
```lua
local Value = Thread:Value(33)
Thread:Create "TextLabel" {
    Text = Thread:Do(function(Grab, Thread, Entity)
        local CurrentValue = Grab(Value)
        return `{CurrentValue} is the current number`
    end)
}
```
Just like functions, <mark>you can create new Faye Instances with Do</mark> but it doesn't have a rince and repeat like system, so it will nnever delete the old stuff it created when it receives a new changed signal calling.
## State
State uses a rince and repeat like system, so it will clean the last session before running the new one, so it solves the entire problem of the Do code block
```lua
local Value = Thread:Value(false)
Thread:Create "TextLabel" {
    Thread:State(function(Grab, InnerThread, Entity)
        local CurrentValue = Grab(Value)
        if CurrentValue then
            return InnerThread:Create "Frame" {
                ...
            }
        else
            return {
                Text = "Unable to create frame"
            }
        end
    end)
}
```
<mark>**Everything created within the State utility must be created using the InnerThread provided on the 2nd parameter**</mark> otherwise it won't clean previous sessions properly.
## Reactive
As you have probably already guessed, State, and Do only work in props tables, if u want a similar system to use outside of a props table you can use the **Reactive** utility.
```lua
local Value = Thread:Value(12)
local ValueButAdd30 = Thread:Value()
Thread:Reactive(function(Grab)
    local Current = Grab(Value)
    ValueButAdd30:Set(Current + 30)
end)
```
The Reactive Utility, only has 1 parameter and its the Grab function.
:::info
You can grab as many Values as you want and it will react to all of their changes, there's no rule of when u can grab them, it can be now or in the future
