# Cleanup and Lifecycle
Faye provides special props to control how instances are cleaned up.

## OnClean
`OnClean` is called <mark>before the instance is destroyed</mark>. It behaves differently depending on whether `CleanDelay` is also present:

### OnClean without CleanDelay
When used on its own, `OnClean` adds the instance to its InnerThread and <mark>waits for all animations in the InnerThread to finish before destroying</mark>. This is the recommended way to do cleanup animations.

```lua
Thread:Create "Frame" {
    Parent = parent,

    OnClean = function(InnerThread, Entity)
        -- Entity is added to InnerThread automatically
        -- Faye waits for these animations to complete before destroying
        return {
            BackgroundTransparency = InnerThread:Animation(1, Thread.Info(0.3))
        }
    end
}
```

### OnClean with CleanDelay
When both are present, <mark>`OnClean` becomes a `CleanFunction`</mark> - it runs during cleanup but the instance destruction is controlled by the `CleanDelay` timer instead of waiting for animations.

```lua
Thread:Create "Frame" {
    Parent = parent,

    OnClean = function(InnerThread, Entity)
        -- This runs as a CleanFunction since CleanDelay is present
        -- Destruction timing is controlled by CleanDelay, not animations
        return {
            BackgroundTransparency = InnerThread:Animation(1, Thread.Info(0.5))
        }
    end,

    CleanDelay = 0.5
}
```

The callback receives:
- **InnerThread**: A dedicated thread for cleanup operations
- **Entity**: The Roblox Instance being cleaned

## CleanDelay
`CleanDelay` delays the destruction of an instance by a specified time (in seconds).

```lua
Thread:Create "Frame" {
    Parent = parent,

    CleanDelay = 2 -- Wait 2 seconds before destroying
}
```

### Dynamic delay
You can also pass a function to calculate the delay:

```lua
Thread:Create "Frame" {
    Parent = parent,

    CleanDelay = function(InnerThread, Entity)
        -- Calculate delay based on some condition
        return Entity.AbsoluteSize.X > 100 and 1 or 0.5
    end
}
```

## CleanFunction
`CleanFunction` runs during cleanup but <mark>does not control when the instance is destroyed</mark>. Unlike `OnClean` (without CleanDelay), it won't wait for animations to finish.

```lua
Thread:Create "Frame" {
    CleanFunction = function(InnerThread, Entity)
        -- Runs during cleanup, but doesn't delay destruction
        print("Cleaning up")
    end
}
```

:::info
When you use `OnClean` together with `CleanDelay`, the `OnClean` is internally treated as a `CleanFunction`. Use `OnClean` alone if you want Faye to automatically wait for animations to finish.
:::

## InnerThread
When you use `OnClean` or `CleanDelay`, Faye automatically creates an `InnerThread` for the instance. This thread:

- Is a child of the main thread
- Gets destroyed after the instance cleanup completes
- Can be used to track cleanup-specific resources

```lua
Thread:Create "Frame" {
    Parent = parent,

    OnClean = function(InnerThread, Entity)
        -- InnerThread is automatically created
        -- Use it for cleanup animations/operations

        InnerThread:Create "Frame" {
            Parent = Entity,
            -- This child will also be cleaned properly
        }
    end
}
```

## Cleanup Order
When a thread is destroyed:

1. **Priority items** are cleaned first (connections added with `Thread:Add(item, true)`)
2. **Regular items** are cleaned in reverse order (last added = first cleaned)
3. **Child threads** are recursively cleaned
4. **Instance cleanup** runs (`CleanFunction` if present, then `OnClean` if present)
5. For `OnClean` without `CleanDelay`: waits for all InnerThread animations to finish, then destroys
6. For `CleanDelay`: waits the delay duration, then destroys

## Best Practices

### Do use OnClean for:
- Fade out animations
- Logging/analytics
- Notifying other systems
- Cleaning external resources

### Don't use OnClean for:
- Long-running operations (blocks cleanup)
- Creating new permanent UI (it will be destroyed)
- Heavy computations

### Example: Notification with auto-dismiss
```lua
local function Notification(message, duration)
    local Thread = Faye.new()

    Thread:Create "Frame" {
        Parent = notificationContainer,

        Thread:Create "TextLabel" {
            Text = message
        },

        OnClean = function(InnerThread, Entity)
            return {
                Position = InnerThread:Animation(
                    UDim2.new(1, 0, 0, 0),
                    Thread.Info(0.3)
                )
            }
        end,

        CleanDelay = 0.3
    }

    -- Auto-destroy after duration
    Thread:Delay(duration, function()
        Thread:Destroy()
    end)

    return Thread
end
```
